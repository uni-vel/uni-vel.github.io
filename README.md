Creating a personal website for the platform UNI-VEl

The platform is used by students primarily from JKUAT and Kenyatta University

The purpose is to revolutionalize the mode of transport used by students as they commute to and from school.

The basic functionality is similar to that of personalized taxi services (Like Uber), only that we charge the normal prices and
we use simple means of transport like 14 seater matatus and 33 seater buses.
